### Useful resources

- [MDN <template>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/template) - I wanted to read more about templating to understand how to dynamically change the content per entry. As I read this document, I saw a wonderful example under 'Generating Table Rows'. It showed that I could use querySelector on parent elements! This has opened new doors for me. :'D
