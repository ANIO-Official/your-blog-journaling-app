The purpose of this project is to test my ability to manipulate the DOM, handle user events, implement form validation, and utilize localStorage for data persistence. Users should be able to:

- Create New Posts
- Read/View Displayed Posts

### Built with
- JavaScript
- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- BootStrap/Other CSS Libraries


### Useful resources

- [MDN <template>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/template) - I wanted to read more about templating to understand how to dynamically change the content per entry. As I read this document, I saw a wonderful example under 'Generating Table Rows'. It showed that I could use querySelector on parent elements! This has opened new doors for me. :'D

- [MDN array.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) -I used this to help me locate the specific blog by title to delete from the array which would then be updated in local storage.
